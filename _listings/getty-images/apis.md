  description: "Use this endpoint to generate download URLs and related data for videos
    you are authorized to download.\r\n\r\nMost product offerings have enforced periodic
    download limits such as monthly, weekly, and daily. When this operation executes,
    the count of allowed downloads is decremented by one for the product offering.
    Once the download limit is reached for a given product offering, no further downloads
    may be requested for that product offering until the next download period.\r\n\r\nThe
    download limit for a given download period is covered in your product agreement
    established with Getty Images.\r\n\r\nYou'll need an API key and a [Resource Owner
    Grant or Implicit Grant](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html)
    access token to use this resource. Please see our [Getting Started](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/getting-started.html)
    page for more information on how to sign up for an API key. \r\n\r\n## Auto Downloads\r\nThe
    `auto_download` request query parameter specifies whether to automatically download
    the video.\r\n\r\nIf the `auto_download` request query parameter is set to _true_,
    the API will return an HTTP status code 303 *See Other*.\u2002Your client code
    will need to process this response and redirect to the URI specified in the *Location*
    header to enable you to automatically download the file. The redirection workflow
    follows the [HTTP 1.1 protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.4).\r\n\r\nClient
    Request:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://api.gettyimages.com/v3/downloads/videos/[asset_id]?auto_download=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nServer
    Response:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 303 See Other\r\nLocation: https://delivery.gettyimages.com/...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf
    the `auto_download` request query parameter is set to false, the API will return
    a HTTP status code 200, along with the URI in the response body which can be used
    to download the video. \r\n\r\nClient Request:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://api.gettyimages.com/v3/downloads/videos/[asset_id]?auto_download=false\r\n```\r\n\r\nServer
    Response:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n{\r\n\t\"uri\": \"https://delivery.gettyimages.com/...\"\r\n}\r\n```"
