name: Viddler
description: Viddler is a video site that allows users to upload, enhance and share
  their video from their browser. The site charges premium fees to users who want
  to use upgraded features, and also allows users to upload in bulk, add deep tags
  at specific times during videos and record directly from their webcam. In November
  2007 viddler introduced an ad system enabling advertisers to bid on videos with
  relevant keyword tags about the whole video or a specific point in time during the
  video with the keyword tag in question.  As part of the ad system rollout, uploaders
  can also sign up to partner in a revenue share with viddler for advertising served
  during their videos.
